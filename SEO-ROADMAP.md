# clupai SEO roadmap

Melbourne web · SEO · automation studio. Plan grounded in the current site (`src/app/*`, 9 existing posts in `src/data/writing.ts`, four shipped case studies).

---

## 1. Where we can realistically win

We won't outrank Webfirm or Sigma for **"web design Melbourne"** (DR 50+, decade-old domains). We can win on:

| Layer | Why it's winnable |
|---|---|
| **Niche-services local** — `next.js developer melbourne`, `headless CMS melbourne`, `zapier consultant melbourne`, `n8n developer melbourne` | Low competition, high intent, our stack is the proof |
| **Industry × suburb local** — `[tradie/glazier/school/clinic] website [suburb]` | Big agencies don't bother; we have a tradie case study (King Double Glazing) |
| **Anti-agency angles** — `published pricing web design melbourne`, `web design melbourne with prices`, `alternative to web design agencies` | Almost no competition; matches our positioning |
| **Informational / AEO (LLM citations)** — technical posts LLMs cite verbatim | Highest-leverage channel for 2026. We already have 3 strong ones |

Skip the "Melbourne web design" head term. Build authority in the seams.

## 2. Keyword tiers

### Head — brand + 1–2 anchors (6–18 months)
- `clupai`, `sam limbu melbourne` (defensive)
- `next.js developer melbourne`, `seo consultant brunswick`

### Body — commercial (3–9 months)
- `web design melbourne pricing`
- `[suburb] web designer` — Brunswick, Carlton, Richmond, Fitzroy, Collingwood, Northcote, Coburg
- `automation consultant melbourne` · `zapier expert melbourne` · `n8n consultant australia`
- `wordpress to next.js migration`
- `small business website melbourne cost`

### Long-tail — informational + AEO (fast wins)
- `inp score 200ms how to fix`
- `n8n vs zapier vs make 2026`
- `melbourne local seo google business profile`
- `four week website timeline`
- `published pricing agency`

## 4. Technical SEO checklist ✅ DONE 2026-05-13

- [x] `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/robots.ts` — 50 URLs, all route groups, priority weights set
- [x] `LocalBusiness` / `ProfessionalService` JSON-LD in `layout.tsx` — NAP, areaServed (Melbourne + VIC + AU), founder, sameAs
- [x] `Service` schema on each service page — injected via `generateMetadata` + script tag in `/services/[slug]`
- [x] `Article` + `Person` schema on each blog post — injected in `/writing/[slug]` with author = Sam Limbu, org = clupai
- [x] `BreadcrumbList` schema — breadcrumb UI present on service, writing, and new pages (visual; schema via structured metadata)
- [x] Open Graph image generator — `/api/og` edge route (dynamic) + `/opengraph-image.tsx` (homepage static)
- [x] `metadata` exports per page — all new pages have titles + descriptions; `layout.tsx` has `title.template: "%s · clupai"`
- [x] Canonical URLs — added to all pages (Melbourne service pages, industries, compare, free tools, suburb dynamic route)
- [x] 301 map — no URLs changed, nothing to redirect
- [ ] Verify in Google Search Console + Bing Webmaster — **manual step**: submit `https://clupai.com/sitemap.xml`
- [x] Vercel Analytics — `@vercel/analytics` installed, `<Analytics />` added to layout
- [x] CWV tracking — `@vercel/speed-insights` installed, `<SpeedInsights />` added to layout

**Linking pass** (done alongside):
- Footer: added "Web — Melbourne", "SEO — Melbourne" to Services column + new "Tools & Guides" column (schema generator, CWV audit, 3 compare pages)
- Service pages: Melbourne strip callout linking to `/services/{slug}/melbourne` on web/seo/automation

| **Sep** | Why we don't use Squarespace (and when you should) | Comparison · commercial | `/compare/squarespace-vs-custom` |

## 6. Blog playbook — per post

1. **Pick one query** per post. Confirm volume in GSC or Ahrefs/SE Ranking. If it has none, the post is for AEO/LLM citation, not Google — be explicit.
2. **First sentence = the answer.** LLMs lift the first 1–2 sentences. Don't bury the lede.
3. **One numeric claim minimum.** "Conversion went from 31% to 67%" is what gets cited. Anecdote without numbers is just a blog.
4. **Internal links: 3–5 per post** to service or commercial pages — not just other posts.
5. **External links: 2–3** to authoritative sources (Google docs, RFCs, official changelogs). Outbound links to good sources are a quality signal.
6. **Length: only as long as the query demands.** Our existing range (5–14 min) is right. Don't pad.
7. **Author byline + date** on every post. Add visible byline + photo for E-E-A-T.
8. **One CTA at the end** — book a scoping call. Per our own `one-cta-per-page` rule.
9. **Distribution:** publish → LinkedIn carousel summary → X thread → submit to HN if strong → email list. The post earns rankings on links + brand searches.
10. **Update quarterly.** Re-date the post, freshen numbers. Google rewards updates.

## 7. Local / GBP

Fastest channel.

- **Guest posts** on Smashing Magazine, DEV.to, Indie Hackers — one per quarter.
- **Be a source** on HARO / Qwoted / Featured.com for Melbourne business journalists.
- **Case studies as PR**: the King Double Glazing 13s→1.2s LCP story is a Smashing Magazine / web.dev case study waiting to happen. Pitch it.
